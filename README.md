# Full-Stack App with React and a REST API

This is a client for the [REST API](https://github.com/karla-codes/rest-api) I created. This full-stack app provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses.

Users can:

- retrieve a list of courses
- view details for a specific course
- create, update, and delete courses
- create an account and sign in to make changes to the database

## Built With

3. Run API

```
$ cd ..
$ cd api
$ npm start
```

```
